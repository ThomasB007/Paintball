    <p5/>In this game, you use WASD keys or Up, Down, Left and Right keys to move around. The "Up" and "Down" keys move you forward and backwards, where as the "Left" and "Right" keys are used to look around. The aim of this game is to shoot the enemies and 
    by pressing your mouse button down before the enemies kill you! You use your mouse to look around and aim your gun. By the way there are apples on the trees and they get redder as time goes on. Once they are fully ripe, they fall off the tree. Hope you enjoy Paintball!<p5>
